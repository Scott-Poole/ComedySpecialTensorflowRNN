# ComedySpecialTensorflowRNN

Simple Python notebook to collect data, train a model, and generate jokes  
in the format of a comedy special. Uses tensorflow and follows tensorflow's RNN  
sample project pretty closely.  
  
Collects data from scrapsfromtheloft.com/stand-up-comedy-scripts  

### Note about comedy.py

This script is just the a copy/paste of cells from the Jupyter Notebook  
and has not been tested. Included mainly for github readability.  


### Results

#### Training
Each epoch took about 1 hour and 20 minutes to train  
Trained 14 epochs  

#### Analysis
Given that the model predicts one character at a time, I am always  
amazed to see the result is even somewhat understandable.  The jokes  
are not good, but it is interesting to see the model picks up on the "flow"  
of a comedian's standup show.
